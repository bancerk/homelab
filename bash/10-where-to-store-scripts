sudo mv update.sh /usr/local/bin/update

#   moves "update.sh" script to local universal system binary repository, aka "/usr/local/bin" and renames file to "update"
#   this allows the script to be run from any directory in the terminal by simply typing "update" and pressing enter

sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/update

#   changes ownership of the script to root user and root group, so that any user can run the script with elevated permissions

#   alternatively, instead of moving the script to "/usr/local/bin", you can add the directory containing the script to the PATH environment variable
#   to do this, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
#   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory
#   replace "/path/to/directory" with the actual path to the directory containing the script
#   then run the following command to apply the changes:
#   source ~/.bashrc
#   this will allow you to run the script from any directory by simply typing the script name and pressing enter

#   or as an another alternative, you can create a symbolic link to the script in the "/usr/local/bin" directory
#   to do this, run the following command:
#   sudo ln -s /path/to/script /usr/local/bin/scriptname
#   replace "/path/to/script" with the actual path to the script and "scriptname" with the desired name of the script
#   this will create a symbolic link to the script in the "/usr/local/bin" directory, allowing you to run the script from any directory by typing the script name and pressing enter
